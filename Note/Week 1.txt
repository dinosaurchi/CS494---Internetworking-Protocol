	* Chapter 1: 

		Def of Internet: networkd of networks 
			- Millions of connected computing devices
				host (end system) : the thing contains the network applications
			- Communication links
				transmission rate: bandwidth
			- Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
				routers and switches 

		Protocol: controlling the sending and receiving messages procudure
			TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype....

		Network entity : including host (end system), switch, router,...
		Network edge : 
			hosts: clients and servers
			servers often in data centers
		Network core : 
			interconnected routers 
			network of networks

		Access net: 
			DSL 
			Cable network: the frequency increases from the left to the right (of the Channels described in the picture)
			=> Cable is for sharing access network thus it will be slower if there is multiple people using the same cables, while the speed of DSL is the same, not matter how many people using the network because it has dedicated access to the central office 
			Home network

		Ethernet (Enterprise access network)

		Wireless access network:
			Wireless LANs (WiFi)
			Wide-area wireless access 

		Physical media: 
			bit, physical link, guided media (transfer via cooper wire,...), unguided media (transfer freely, for instance : radio)
			Twisted pair cable : we twist 2 core cooper wires because it will reduce electrical interference
			Coaxial cable: 
			Fiber optic cable

		Network core: 

		Packet Switching : store-and-forward : When a packet arrives a router, the router has to wait until the entire packet being sent to the router, then forward it 

		Network-core functions: 
			Routing: 
				Local forwarding table: comes from routing algorithm
			Forwarding:

		Circuit switching:
			FDM: Frequency Division Multiplexing
			TDM: Time Division Multiplexing

		d_trans : The time it needs to put the packet to the link = L/R 
		d_prop : The time it needs to propagate the packet on the link = d/s
		=> 

Internet protocol stack:
	Application
		SMTP (Simple mail transfer protocol) : transfer mail 
		HTTP : for transfering hyper text
		FPT : transfer file

	Transport: Process-Process (There might have many processes on one host)
		TCP (Transmission control protocol)
		UDP (User Datagram protocol)

	Network : Host-Host
		IP (Internet Protocol)
		Routing protocols

	Link : 
		Ethernet, WiFi, PPP

	Physical:
		bits on wire
