	Network layer: 
		Includes: 
			IP protocol
			Internet routing protocols (including RIP, OSPF, and BGP)
			ICMP

		router examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it

		2 key functions: 
			Forwarding:
				move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output

				forwards a packet by examin- ing the value of a field in the arriving packet’s header, and then using this header value to index into the router’s forwarding table

			Routing: 
				determine route taken by packets from source to dest. 

				The routing algorithm may be centralized (e.g., with an algorithm executing on a central site and down- loading routing information to each of the routers) or decentralized (i.e., with a piece of the distributed routing algorithm running in each router)

			Connection setup:
				3rd important function (in some network artchitectures)
					ATM
					Frame relay, X.25 

	network vs transport layer connection service:
		network: 
			between two hosts (may also involve intervening routers in case of VCs)
		transport: 
			between two processes

	Network-layer services for Individual datagram:
		Guaranteed delivery:
			This service guarantees that the packet will eventually arrive at its destination.
		Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay:
			This service not only guarantees deliv- ery of the packet, but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay bound (for example, within 100 msec).

	Network-layer services for flow of datagram:
		in-order datagram delivery
		guaranteed minimum bandwidth to flow
		restrictions on changes in inter-packet spacing
		security service

	Network-layer service models:
		Internet : Best effort model 
			-> Guarantees nothing

		CBR: Constant bit rate, ATM network service
		ABR: Available bit rate, ATM network service

	datagram network:
		provides network-layer connectionless service
	virtual-circuit network:
		provides network-layer connection service

	=> 
		service: host-to-host
		no choice: network provides one or the other
		implementation: in network core

	Virtual Circuit:
		Consists of: 
			path from source to destination
			VC numbers: 
				one number for each link along path
			entries in forwarding tables: 
				in routers along path

		packet belonging to VC carries VC number (rather than dest address)

		VC number can be changed on each link.
			new VC number comes from forwarding table

	Datagram networks:
		no call setup at network layer
		routers: no state about end-to-end connections
			no network-level concept of “connection”
		packets forwarded using destination host address


	Internet (Datagram) vs. ATM (VC):
		Datagram: 
			Simple inside network
			Complex at edge
		VC:
			complex inside network

	What's inside a router:
		Input port: 
			Physcial layer -> Data link layer -> Ethernet (lookup forwarding table for input port)

		Switching fabric: 
			Transfer from input port to appropriate output port 
				3 types:
					Memory, bus, crossbar

		Output port:
			Ethernet (Datagram (packets) can be lost due to congestion, lack of buffers) -> Link layer -> physical layer

			Tasks:
				Buffering
					buffering when arrival rate via switch exceeds output line speed

				Scheduling
					queueing (delay) and loss due to output port buffer overflow!

			Buffering = RTT * Capacity / sqrt(N flows)

		Internet Protocol has nothing to do with finding the route

	IP addressing:
		interface: connection between host/router and physical link

		Subnet

		CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing
			a.b.c.d/x

		DHCP: 
			Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: dynamically get address from as server

			DHCP discover: Host broadcast
			DHCP offer: Server broadcast
			DHCP request: Host confirms with server
			DHCP ACK: Server confirms

			DHCP can return more than just allocated IP address on subnet:
				- address of first-hop router for client
				- name and IP address of DNS sever
				- network mask 
					+ (indicating network versus host portion of address)	

			DHCP request encapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated in 802.I Ethernet

		Hierarchical Addressing allows efficient advertisement of routing information


		ISP get block addresses:
			ICANN: Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers:
				allocates addresses
				manages DNS
				assigns domain names, resolves disputes

	Network Address Translation (NAT)
		outgoing datagrams: replace
		remember (in NAT translation table) 
		incoming datagrams: replace

	NAT traversal problem:
		UPnP
		Relaying


	ICMP:
		used by hosts & routers to communicate network-level information

		network-layer “above” IP:
			ICMP msgs carried in IP datagrams

		ICMP message: 
			type, code plus first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error

			ICMP messages (type 11, code 0)
			ICMP “port unreachable” message (type 3, code 3)

	IPv6:
		40 bytes header, 128 bits addresses
		
		No fragments
			IPv6 does not allow for fragmentation and reassem- bly at intermediate routers; these operations can be performed only by the source and destination. If an IPv6 datagram received by a router is too large to be for- warded over the outgoing link, the router simply drops the datagram and sends a “Packet Too Big” ICMP error message (see below) back to the sender.
		
		no checksum
		
		option moved to outside of the header => 

		Next header field
		
		ICMPv6


	IPv6 -> IPv4: 
		IPv4 contains IPv6 as payload if the router does not support IPv6
			-> Tunneling 



	Routing algorithm:
		routing algorithm determines end-end-path through network

		forwarding table determines local forwarding at this router

		Classifications: 
			- Global or Decentralized
			- Dynamic or Static

		Link state 
		Distance vector

		Hierachical routing
			aggregate routers into regions, “autonomous systems” (AS)

			“intra-AS” routing protocol

			routers in different AS can run different intra-AS routing protocol





Chap 5: Link layer
	
	Link layer services:
		framing, link access
	reliable delivery between adjacent nodes
	flow control: 
	error detection
	error correction
	half-duplex and full-duplex
		with half duplex, nodes at both ends of link can transmit, but not at same time

	Link layer is Implemented in:
		in each and every host
		link layer implemented in “adaptor” (aka network interface card NIC) or on a chip

	2 types of links:
		Point to point
		broadcast

	Multiple access protocols:
		single shared broadcast channel 
		two or more simultaneous transmissions by nodes: interference 
			collision if node receives two or more signals at the same time
